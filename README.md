This bot tackles computational photography from a critical perspective. By questioning how the our online Platforms are shaping our understanding of socio/cultural phenomenons, this software is a variation on the Oroboro figure — *burning* the image it randomly picks by its own analytics.

Using the affordances of Twitter as a modus operandi to perform with/on/upon the Platform, the bot follows a simple command: the more the original image will be viewed, the less it’s copy will be understood.
